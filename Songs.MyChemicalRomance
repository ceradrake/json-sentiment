{"lyrics": "They're gonna clean up your looks\r\nWith all the lies in the books\r\nTo make a citizen out of you\r\nBecause they sleep with a gun\r\nAnd keep an eye on you, son\r\nSo they can watch all the things you do\n\n\n\nBecause the drugs never work\n\nThey're gonna give you a smirk\n\n'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean\n\nThey're gonna rip up your heads,\n\nYour aspirations to shreds\n\nAnother cog in the murder machine\n\n\n\nThey say those teenagers scare the living shit out of me\n\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\n\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\n\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\n\n\n\nThe boys and girls in the clique\n\nThe awful names that they stick\n\nYou're never gonna fit in much, kid\n\nBut if you're troubled and hurt\n\nWhat you got under your shirt\n\nWill make them pay for the things that they did\n\n\n\nThey say those teenagers scare the living shit out of me\n\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\n\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\n\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\n\n\n\nOhhh yeah!\n\n\n\nThey say those teenagers scare the living shit out of me\n\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\n\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\n\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\n\n\n\nAll together now!\n\n\n\nTeenagers scare the living shit out of me\n\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\n\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\n\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me\n\n\n\nTeenagers scare the living shit out of me\n\nThey could care less as long as someone'll bleed\n\nSo darken your clothes or strike a violent pose\n\nMaybe they'll leave you alone, but not me"}
